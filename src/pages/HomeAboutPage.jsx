          <p className="textcopy">I've had a love for computers my whole life but it wasn't until I was accepted into Pursuitâ€”a selective year-long intensive <strong>full-stack</strong> coding fellowship, that I was able to discover how much I truly enjoy being in the world of software tech.</p>

          <p className="textcopy">My experience in the visual arts and political psychology has been a great well to draw from when working on <strong>UI/UX</strong> and front-ends but I'm just as intrigued, if not more, with the <strong>problem solving</strong> and <strong>structural architecturing</strong> of back-end coding.</p>

          <p className="textcopy">I'm looking to find an <strong>rich and diverse environment</strong> where I can grow as an engineer and as a <strong>teammate</strong>.</p>
