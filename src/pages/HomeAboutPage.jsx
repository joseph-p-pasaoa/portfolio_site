          <p className="text para">I've had a love for computers my whole life but it wasn't until I was chosen into <a href="https://www.pursuit.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="link--homepursuit">Pursuit</a> â€”a selective yearlong intensive <strong>full-stack web</strong> coding fellowship, that I was able to discover how much I truly enjoy being in the world of software tech.</p>

          <p className="text para">My experiences in the visual arts and political psychology have been a great well to draw from when working on <strong>UI/UX</strong> and front-ends however I'm just as intrigued, if not more, with the <strong>problem solving</strong>, <strong>optimization work</strong>, and <strong>structural architecturing</strong> found in both ends.</p>

          <p className="text para">I'm looking to find an <strong>rich and diverse environment</strong> where I can grow as an engineer and as a <strong>teammate</strong>.</p>

          <p className="text para">Thanks for finding out more about me.</p>
