          <p className="text para">My experiences in the visual arts and political psychology have been a great well to draw from when working on <strong>UI/UX</strong> and front-ends but I'm just as fascinated with the <strong>problem solving</strong>, <strong>optimizing</strong>, and <strong>design process</strong> found across the stack.</p>

          <p className="text para">I'm looking to find an <strong>rich and diverse environment</strong> where I can grow doubly as an engineer and as a <strong>teammate</strong>.</p>
