// Hello!
// I am a Software Engineer & Full-Stack Developer
const aboutMeCopy = `
My name is Joseph P. Pasaoa and I studied International Relations and Comparative Politics in college. Years since, I've been a freelance photographer and First Assistant to a high-fashion photographer. I've had a love for computers my whole life but it wasn't until I was accepted into Pursuit, a selective intensive coding yearlong fellowship, that I discovered how much I enjoy exploring and learning all things tech.
\n
My curriculum was primarily the PERN stack (PostgreSQL, ExpressJS, React, NodeJS) and my experience in the visual arts and political psychology has been a great well to draw from when working on UI/UX and front-end. However, I find myself just as, if not more intrigued with problem solving and structure architecturing of back-end work.
\n
I'm looking to find an rich and diverse environment where I can grow as an engineer and as a teammate.
