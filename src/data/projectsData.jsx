    difficulties: `The assignment for the Uber-sponsored Hackatahon was to create an app to aid in the fashion-sustainability movement, however most in our group hardly knew anything about the fashion industry. With the help of industry advisors, we were able to identify a large gap in the workflow of small and independent designers that we could build something for. Uber developers guided us through dry and performant database query writing and walked us through professional example stages of production and git flow.`,
