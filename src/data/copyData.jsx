<p className="textcopy">I studied International Relations and Comparative Politics in college.</p>

<p className="textcopy">I've been a freelance photographer and First Assistant to a high-fashion photographer.</p>

<p className="textcopy">I've had a love for computers my whole life but it wasn't until I was accepted into Pursuit, a selective year-long intensive <strong>full-stack</strong> coding fellowship, that I discovered how much I truly enjoy being in the world of software tech.</p>

{/* My curriculum was primarily the PERN stack (PostgreSQL, ExpressJS, React, NodeJS) and  */}

<p className="textcopy">My experience in the visual arts and political psychology has been a great well to draw from when working on <strong>UI/UX</strong> and front-ends but I find myself just as, if not more, intrigued with the <strong>problem solving</strong> and <strong>structural architecturing</strong> in back-end coding.</p>

<p className="textcopy">I'm looking to find an <strong>rich and diverse environment</strong> where I can grow as an engineer and as a <strong>teammate</strong>.</p>
