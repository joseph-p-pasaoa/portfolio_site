<p className="text--copy__paragraph">My name is Joseph P. Pasaoa and I studied International Relations and Comparative Politics in college. For a few years since, I've been a freelance photographer and First Assistant to a high-fashion photographer. I've had a love for computers my whole life but it wasn't until I was accepted into Pursuit, a selective yearlong coding intensive fellowship, that I discovered how much I enjoy exploring and learning the world of software tech.</p>

<p className="text--copy__paragraph">My curriculum was primarily the PERN stack (PostgreSQL, ExpressJS, React, NodeJS) and my experience in the visual arts and political psychology has been a great well to draw from when working on UI/UX and front-end. However, I find myself just as, if not more intrigued with the problem solving and structural architecturing of back-end work.</p>

<p className="text--copy__paragraph">I'm looking to find an rich and diverse environment where I can grow as an engineer and as a teammate.</p>

<p className="text--copy__paragraph">Hello world!</p>
